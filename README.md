# Travel website Frontend

This repository contains the frontend for a travel website built as a University project.
The project is separated the frontend, contained in this repository, and the backend, contained in the Travel-Website-RESTful-API repository: https://github.com/Viktor-Bubanja/Travel-Website-RESTful-API
The website is made for travellers to explore and review various venues and locations.
Users can create a profile and upload a photo, view venues and locations, leave reviews, as well as administer their own venues with photos and descriptions.

The backend and frontend are both built using JavaScript, using Node.js and Vue.js.

Running the project locally requires a connection to the University of Canterbury's local SQL database, but feel free to have a look at the code.
